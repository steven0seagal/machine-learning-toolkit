# Machine Learning Toolkit

A comprehensive repository for learning and mastering machine learning - from theory to implementation to real-world projects.

## Overview

This repository is organized into three main modules to support a complete machine learning learning journey:

1. **Knowledge Base** - Theoretical foundations and concepts
2. **Algorithms** - Implementations from scratch and with libraries
3. **DIY Projects** - Hands-on projects and real-world applications

## Learning Path

### 1. Build Foundation (Knowledge Base)
Start with the theoretical concepts:
- Mathematical foundations (linear algebra, calculus, probability)
- Core ML concepts (supervised/unsupervised learning, overfitting, etc.)
- Algorithm theory and intuition

**Navigate to**: [`/knowledge-base/`](./knowledge-base/)

### 2. Implement Algorithms
Solidify understanding through implementation:
- Code algorithms from scratch using only NumPy
- Implement using scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Compare implementations and understand trade-offs

**Navigate to**: [`/algorithms/`](./algorithms/)

### 3. Build Projects (DIY)
Apply knowledge to real-world problems:
- Work on complete end-to-end projects
- Experiment with different approaches
- Participate in Kaggle competitions
- Build portfolio projects

**Navigate to**: [`/diy/`](./diy/)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.8+
python --version

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install common dependencies
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
pip install torch torchvision  # For deep learning
```

### Getting Started

1. **Learning Theory**: Read through topics in `/knowledge-base/`
